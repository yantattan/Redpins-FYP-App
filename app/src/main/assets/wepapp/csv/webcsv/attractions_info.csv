So great to get a chance to go with my grandkids. And we had a good day, it really is about the kids for these places.

We really enjoyed the Jurassic river ride (after a wait for the queue) a big surorise at the end. The Shrek 4D was fantastic, don't miss that. I kids enjoyed the roller coaster in Far far away land.

Not all the stuff was open, not sure when it will be. Covid restrictions and staffing I guess.""","""We went for the day to universal studios. Two adults. Cost per person €81.
The park isn’t opening until 12 which we couldn’t only figure must be staffing issues, later discussed with the customer service.
There are a significant number of shops, rides and restaurants closed in the park. Some say for maintenance, some just say closed. This is not advertised when you book your tickets at the front of the park and certainly not reflected in the price. The atmosphere in the park is empty, no characters, no parades happening. As a result of things being closed the queues are longer for the open rides.

I genuinely couldn’t wait for my day out at universal and was so disappointed.

We spoke with customer services who said they wouldn’t refund due to company terms and conditions, but would send us in with an express ticket to get on rides quicker. But the fun was gone. It was a total waste of time.""",peter

You can maximize your ride by boarding from Imbiah Station then alight to Siloso Beach and wander around in Fort Siloso then go back again to the cable car to finish your one round trip. It’s good to have a break to avoid feeling dizzy. And if unsure, just approach the staff, they are friendly and happy to help.""","""It's always an amazing view and quite a cool way to go to the beach.

It's a few stations on the way to the ocean.

It's quite chill inside of the cabin so don't worry that you will get hot ??.

You have to change the cabin a few times every station they staff will ask you to re-enter

Get your camera ready and enjoy the day ahead
